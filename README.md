# homework-week-2
Hello!

This week I attempted to build three pages: an index page, a portfolio page, and a contact page using Bootstrap and grids.  

I struggled with this assignment.  I spent a lot of time on CSS when I should have abandoned a template much sooner than I did. Our instructor likened it to playing poker and having a bad hand-- and I should've folded much earlier.   My navbar was a challenge to get to look right.

I spent a lot of time getting the pictures to line up in the portfolio.  W3 schools suggested a gallery and I tried that without success.  I attempted Flex but not sure I did it right.  I attempted rows and columns and couldn't get the pics to align for quite a while  Found some terminology along the way saying links and anchor tags didn't work in divs, and I didn't have time to dive deep, but somehow it works.  Hyperlink code.com helped with the links, which are related to the pics (The labrador breeder is where we got our dog.  Their gallery will make you want a puppy).  Wanted to make these move, but ran out of time.  This part was a struggle to make work on different screens.  I could not get git to coorperate before deadline.

The contact page is a bootstrap template.  I got rid of the sidebar that had BootStrap's address but left it visible.   The navbar works.   Centered the contents. 

Beki was a huge help Monday and I will attempt to post something more like what was expected, although late.  The pages should be responsive now. 

Having issues with Git that I believe are in my settings.  Week one I had to have help getting it to work and I don't remember what the instructor did.  I attempted to post Saturday before deadline and I don't think it was right so with the adjustments I made today I will get help during office hours and post.  Hopefully.
