# homework-week-2
Hello!

This week I attempted to build three pages: an index page, a portfolio page, and a contact page using Bootstrap and grids.  

I struggled with this assignment.  I spent a lot of time on CSS when I should have abandoned a template much sooner than I did. Our instructor likened it to playing poker and having a bad hand-- and I should've folded much earlier.   My navbar was a challenge to get to look right.

I spent a lot of time getting the pictures to line up in the portfolio.  W3 schools suggested a gallery and I ended up using elements of that, so that the terminology in css wouldn't get confused when going between the three pages.  I attempted rows and colums and couldn't get the pics to align.  Found some terminology along the way saying links and anchor tags didn't work in divs, and I didn't have time to dive deep, but somehow it works.  Hyperlink code.com helped with the links, which are related to the pics (The labrador breeder is where we got our dog.  Their gallery will make you want a puppy).  Wanted to make these move, but ran out of time.  This part was a struggle to make work on different screens, and I don't thing I achieved it before deadline. 

The contact page is a bootstrap template.  I got rid of the sidebar that had BootStrap's address but left it visible.   The navbar works.
